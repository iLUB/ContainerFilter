ContainerFilter
=============

An ILIAS UserInterfaceHook Plugin to filter the entries in containers (repository and/or personal desktop)

TODO
----

Test if this UserInterfaceHook still works with newer ILIAS versions. Due to the dependency on the DOM elements, this
plugin is expected to be broken on ILIAS 5.0
